# Hi, I’m @zanuartri 👋
I enjoy exploring the intersection of robust backend logic and modern AI implementation. Currently, I'm focusing on building efficient systems and exploring how AI can enhance software functionality.

### 🧩 Current Focus
- **Backend Core:** Deep diving into **Java** for building scalable and reliable services.
- **AI Integration:** Implementing **LLMs** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to bridge the gap between data and AI intelligence.
- **On the Radar:** Looking forward to exploring **Go** or **Rust** for high-performance systems.

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Java and Spring Ecosystem (Primary)
- **AI Implementation:** LLM Orchestration, MCP Servers.
- **Interests:** System Architecture, API Design, and Automation.
